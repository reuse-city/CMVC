# Sorting

Processes for a first-layer of sorting and assessment of the potential reuse value of goods and materials.

**TODO**

- [ ] Re-contextualise [../background](background research) - particularly expanding the [graph on repair processes](../background/process.png).
- [ ] Invite more participants to fill the survey.

## 1. Visual inspection

- Cleanliness. Indicator of
	- state
	- potential failures
	- care
- Category - type and subtype of product/material
- Model and Type / Make - Indicator of
	- age
	- potential resale value
	- popularity - indicator of
		- potential resale value - in a complex manner: in some categories, popularity is associated with the product being more affordable - hence not rare, lower resale value. In other categories, popularity comes from it being available and tested by masses, arguably easier to repair and maintain, higher resale value. ++ Which categories? 
- Wear and Tear

## 2. Manual inspection 

- Build material - particularly on categories such as textiles, furniture, kitchen equipment, tools, and others. Indicator of quality, durability, and potential resale value.
- Integrity - are there any missing parts? Hinges, articulated parts, closing mechanisms, legs, lids, hulls, physical buttons/keys, etc. 

## 3. Functional inspection

- Is the object able to perform its originally intended purpose? 
- Electrical/Electronics - functionality test
	- PAT test
	- Does it turn on?
	- Can it perform all of its functionalities? - potentially complex and specific depending on category. In some cases, one function is an indication that all the others are working, others require deeper inspection and/or longer testing times (e.g. calculator vs. laptop).

## 4. Market value assessment

- State - either
	- predefined status (e.g. new > very good > fair > malfunctioning > broken > good for spares > junk)
	- typology and functionality descriptions
- Typical price in 2nd hand market - connected to functionality, popularity, time-related considerations, ...
- Does it require transformation / physical intervention? Of what kind (clean, repair, replace, upcycle, repurpose, ...)?

## 5. Social value assessment

- Are there social groups or communities that could benefit from the product? If so,
	- Local groups - considerations of time, storage space, availability
	- Groups in other locations - considerations of logistics costs, ownership/regulation aspects

## 6. Environmental value assessment

- What is the environmental of discarding / recycling the object?
