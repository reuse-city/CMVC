# Online Survey

**[Analysis](README.md) > Online Survey**

The Online Survey had eight responses in total. Survey results show a few key themes and perspectives from the participants.

The survey highlighted the diverse motivations of those involved in material reuse, combining professional and personal interests. A common sentiment was the importance of the educational aspect and the need for more structured knowledge sharing.

One participant articulated this by stating that "the reuse movement is a culture of learning and teaching". Another emphasized the gap between theory and practice, noting that "people have good intentions, but often lack the practical skills and knowledge of where to find the tools and parts".

The responses also pointed to the importance of community and social engagement in the process. One participant specifically mentioned the role of social networks and local initiatives in facilitating reuse, saying, "local grassroots communities are the most effective way to share knowledge and materials". This reinforces the project's focus on decentralized, bottom-up approaches to waste prevention.
