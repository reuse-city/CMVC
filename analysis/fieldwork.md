# Analysis of CMVC Fieldwork and Research Activities

**[Analysis](README.md) > Fieldwork**

This document synthesizes the key insights and observations gathered during the [fieldwork](../fieldwork) and [background research](../background) phases of the Circular Material Valuer Curriculum (CMVC) project. It moves beyond a simple chronological account of activities to present a thematic analysis of the core tensions, challenges, and opportunities identified by project participants and through on-the-ground observation.

Observations on

- the immense scale of textile sorting
- the logistical challenges of temporary spaces for reuse initiatives
- the role of "Libraries of Things" in sustainable fashion and design

### **Synthesis of Core Findings**

The project's fieldwork consistently revealed a number of central themes. These themes are fundamentally about the tension between two models of circularity: a top-down, industrial approach and a grassroots, community-based one. As one participant noted, the project's initial goal was to understand **"how to train people to identify items that can still be reused."** This simple, practical question led to a deeper investigation of the systemic, technical, social, and political dimensions of material reuse.

1\. The Tension between Centralized and Decentralized Systems  
A primary insight from the fieldwork is the dichotomy between large-scale, aggregated waste management and smaller, highly contextualized reuse initiatives.

* **Industrial-Scale Efficiency:** Visits to facilities like Nochmall and Humana showcased systems designed for processing vast volumes of material quickly. This centralized model prioritizes a specific kind of efficiency, but participants noted that it often leads to a **"lowest common denominator"** approach to valuation. This can result in potentially valuable items being discarded or downcycled simply because they don't fit a standardized, automated process. The challenges of high volume were repeatedly mentioned, with one Nochmall employee estimating that sorters **"walk 30k steps every day, and sort through 5,000 items."**  
* **Community-Based Resilience:** Conversely, decentralized initiatives like repair cafés and local scrap shops excel at nurturing social value. These spaces operate on a human scale, allowing for nuanced material assessment and the building of trust. However, they face significant challenges related to high volumes, funding, and access to storage space in urban environments. One participant described a major obstacle for local circular business models: **"Long-term storage is challenging. Big cities don't have space for that."** The discussions emphasized that urban infrastructure must accommodate both models to create a truly resilient system, citing creative examples like repurposed shopping malls and city-supported reuse centers.

2\. The Crucial Role of Tacit and Embodied Knowledge  
The research confirmed that human expertise, rather than technology alone, is central to effective material valuation. As one participant argued, the purpose of technology in this context is to "augment, but don’t solve the problem alone."

* **Hands-on Experience:** The sheer volume of material at facilities like Humana and Nochmall necessitates a high degree of **tacit knowledge**. The process requires experiential, hands-on skill that cannot be easily replicated by a machine. In an online session, a participant noted that a central part of repair education is having **"somebody who’s got experience, almost acting as the classical – that used to be called the master and the apprentice type of thing."**  
* **Tacit Skills:** Discussions with participants consistently highlighted that the most critical skills for a valuer—such as **curiosity, imagination, and the ability to identify an object's history**—are often learned informally through hands-on experimentation. As one participant noted, a key challenge is that **"youngsters are getting worse and worse on those."**  
* **Human-Centered Technology:** The consensus was that technology's role should be to empower valuers, not replace them. Tools for material identification and data-sharing were seen as valuable for fostering connections. For instance, an AI-powered tool could act as a "chat assistant to guide them to knowledge resources for resale, repair, or missing parts," but the final decision-making power must remain with the human valuer.

3\. The Socio-Economic and Political Dimensions of Reuse  
The project's activities exposed the deep social and political layers underlying material reuse, demonstrating that it is far more than a technical or logistical issue.

* **Repair as an Act of Resistance:** As one participant stated, **"The repair movement’s ultimate value is not only learning repair is possible and desirable. It's an ultimate act of resistance towards things losing value."** This perspective reframes repair as a political act against planned obsolescence and a consumerist culture.  
* **Incentives and Labour:** The fieldwork revealed how global economic shifts, such as international commodity prices, directly impact the livelihoods of grassroots waste pickers. This highlights the need for incentive systems and business models that support a dignified livelihood, as opposed to simply treating waste as a cheap resource. The concept of a professional identity for valuers emerged as a potential source of **"class solidarity,"** particularly in the context of precarious labour. One participant noted that in Brazil's aluminum recycling industry, labor is highly precarious and dependent on international commodity prices, underscoring this point.  
* **The Power of Story:** The emotional connection to objects and their stories was identified as a powerful driver for reuse. The fieldwork uncovered examples of how sharing these stories can transform a discarded object's perceived value, building community bonds and inspiring a sense of collective care. One participant's story about repurposing old wrestling awards into lamps perfectly illustrated this, as the value came from **"taking away information"** about their origin to reveal an aesthetic value.

### **Conceptual Developments and Future Directions**

The synthesis of these findings directly informed the project's outputs and its future trajectory. The curriculum's four-module structure emerged from the need to address all these dimensions—systemic, practical, technical, and human—in a holistic and interconnected way.

The project's ultimate goal is to provide a blueprint for a larger ecosystem. The idea of the **Reuse Academy**, first presented at FAB25, is a direct outcome of this research. It is a conceptual framework for translating the curriculum into a living, collaborative network that fosters these skills and principles. This initiative would build on the connections already established with organisations in Berlin and beyond, aiming to create a sustainable and equitable model for urban material reuse.
