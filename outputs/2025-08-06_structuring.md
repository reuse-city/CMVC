### Planning: Output Structure

**[Outputs](README.md) > Structuring**


The Circular Material Valuer Curriculum (CMVC) project is a **citizen science initiative** that aims to understand the skills, experience, and sensibility required to extend the lifespan of unused or discarded goods. It's a collaborative effort by GIG and the Reuse City studio, supported by the Hans Sauer Stiftung. The project has been engaged in **participatory design activities** from April to September 2025 to develop an openly licensed curriculum.

The project's commitment to openness is reflected in its documentation strategy, which includes:
*   A **GitHub repository** for raw data, anonymised conversation transcripts, and research logs.
*   An **evolving page on the Reuse City wiki**.
*   A project page and blog posts on the GIG website.
*   Final outputs, including the curriculum, will be released under **open licenses**.

#### Summary of Activities Performed (March-August 2025)

This output would detail the project's execution across its four phases:
*   **Background Research:** This involved re-contextualizing prior work, notably the "Generous Cities" doctoral investigation, and gathering relevant existing sources.
*   **Participatory Fieldwork:** This phase included documenting insights from the **online co-design lab ("reuse.city")**, which involved participants from various countries. The lab aimed to deepen the understanding of value assessment skills for material reuse and explore how these could be digitally augmented and replicated. Discussions in these sessions covered topics from the limits of technology in reuse to prototyping speculative tools such as ThingWiki and the Evaluation Interface (E-I). The fieldwork also encompassed **in-person workshops**, such as the "Circular Valuer Skills" workshop held at Kunst-Stoffe in Berlin, where knowledge areas for material valuer education were discussed. Additionally, online surveys were conducted to gather input from individuals experienced in material reuse.
*   **Analysis and Compilation:** This phase focused on analysing the collected data to identify core skills, practical evaluation methods, approaches to material flow management, and the potential role of technology.
*   **Publication of Results and Outputs:** This final phase will involve outlining the open documentation strategy and releasing the curriculum and other public materials under open licenses.

The project's overarching goal is to contribute to a blueprint for **"transformation labs"** that would connect to local zero-waste initiatives and policies, potentially forming a public infrastructure supported by local governments and community partnerships. The aim is not to replace skilled individuals in recycling or zero-waste, but to **enhance and scale their existing skills** where such roles are currently absent.

### Curriculum: Circular Material Valuer

The curriculum is designed to empower individuals in the emerging role of a Circular Material Valuer, focusing on the effective **diversion of reusable goods from the waste stream** through repair, upcycling, adaptation, and recirculation. It integrates material analysis, social awareness, economic evaluation, and environmental responsibility.

Based on your proposed areas and the sources, here's how the curriculum could be structured:

#### 1. Systemic View and Social Value
This area would equip trainees with a critical understanding of the circular economy, emphasizing community-based approaches and the social benefits of reuse.
*   **Rethinking Waste and Circularity:**
    *   Learning the principles of a **circular economy** beyond the linear "take-make-dispose" model, focusing on "reduce-reuse-recycle".
    *   Critically assessing the mainstream circular economy discourse, which often prioritises industrial interests and economic value over social and human aspects.
    *   Understanding the hierarchy of waste management, emphasizing **waste prevention and reuse as priorities** over recycling, incineration, and landfilling due to their lower environmental impact and higher societal value.
*   **Local and Community-Based Approaches:**
    *   Focusing on **ground-level, commons-based waste prevention** and how it contrasts with top-down industrial models. This includes promoting initiatives like **repair cafés, scrap shops, and community networks**.
    *   Developing skills to foster "generous cities" that encourage care practices and transform excess materials into social value.
*   **Social Inclusion and Empowerment:**
    *   Learning how to **leverage existing social groups** involved in material reuse, ensuring they are not marginalized by new developments, but rather supported and equipped.
    *   Techniques for **augmenting and replicating the skills** of experienced individuals, fostering peer-to-peer knowledge sharing and mentorship.
    *   Understanding the **cultural context** of repair and reuse, recognizing how it varies across regions and influences behavior.

#### 2. Eyes and Hands of a Circular Valuer (Materiality and Environmental Value)
This module would delve into the practical assessment skills, material knowledge, and manual operations essential for material valuers, alongside understanding the environmental benefits.
*   **Material Assessment and Properties:**
    *   Training in the role of the **"valoriste"** (valuing agent), focusing on developing material knowledge and assessing the potential value of discarded items.
    *   Practical methods for evaluating items for repair, reuse, recycling, or upcycling, considering factors like physical condition, functionality, and potential demand.
    *   Understanding **materiality** in design—moving from conceptual designs to working with available materials, their properties, and potential transformations. This includes applying the **"Reshape strategy"** for industrial waste to preserve material integrity by leveraging its function, form, or composition in new products, thereby extending their lifetimes.
*   **Manual Operations and Tools:**
    *   Hands-on training in **repair, upcycling, and repurposing** techniques.
    *   Familiarisation with **tools and technologies** for material transformation, ranging from digital fabrication (e.g., 3D printing, laser cutting) to traditional crafts, while ensuring practical applicability.
*   **Environmental Impact Mitigation:**
    *   Assessing the **environmental benefits of reuse**, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and minimizing raw material extraction and waste. This also includes calculating the environmental cost of discarding or recycling an object.
    *   Understanding the issues related to **"downcycling"** where recycled materials are of lower quality than the originals, highlighting the importance of higher-value reuse.

#### 3. Information Systems and Market Value
This module would focus on the digital tools and economic considerations relevant to material valuation.
*   **Data and Information Management:**
    *   Learning to use and contribute to information systems like the concept of a **Universal Registry of Things** (a multi-layered database of objects and their reusability/repairability) and the **Evaluation Interface (E-I)** for identifying objects and retrieving reuse information.
    *   Understanding the **Reuse Dataset** for collecting and publishing open data on material reuse in urban environments, distinguishing it from general recycling data.
    *   Exploring digital tools to optimize the valuer's work, including potential for scanning and linking to existing knowledge bases (e.g., product specifications, repair manuals, spare parts information).
*   **Economic Valuation and Business Models:**
    *   Assessing the **potential resale price** and transactional value of objects, and the factors that influence these, including understanding concepts like use value and exchange value.
    *   Exploring **sustainable business models** for various actors in the reuse ecosystem, such as charity shops, scrap shops, and social enterprises.
    *   Addressing **incentive systems for reuse**, recognizing how policies and economic structures can encourage or hinder material circulation.
    *   Understanding logistical challenges like **storage space**, which can be a significant obstacle for local circular business models.

#### 4. Stories and Personal Value
This section would emphasize the human dimension of reuse, including the emotional connection to objects and the power of storytelling to promote a "generosity" mindset.
*   **Emotional and Cultural Connection:**
    *   Recognizing the **"story" and emotional connection that objects hold**, and how this influences their perceived value and potential for reuse.
    *   Exploring the **"joy of repair"** and the broader "maker culture" as drivers for engaging with materials, fostering creativity and a sense of belonging.
*   **Promoting a Generosity Mindset:**
    *   Adopting the concept of **"generosity"** as an intentional approach to interact with the world and manage excess materials, contrasting it with a passive "abundance".
    *   Learning how **storytelling** and visual representation can highlight the potential value of discarded materials and inspire broader engagement in reuse initiatives.

This comprehensive curriculum aims to equip circular material valuers with a holistic understanding and practical skills to drive a more sustainable and equitable approach to material reuse in cities.
