I visited the Kunst-Stoffe place in [Haus der Materialisierung](../HdM) a number of times since I moved to Berlin, but only recently went to their place in Pankow. And it is there that their nature as a resistance project can be felt more lively. On the day I visited, everyone around was busy on a very hands-on way. They didn't have electricity, construction was taking place. They were building a model zero-waste apartment to show how people can renovate their flats without investing a lot of money. Kunst-Stoffe survives amid quite adverse conditions. They don't have a long-term lease for the building, and are quite critical of the superficial greenwashing seen elsewhere in the circular economy field. To them it is quite clear that it is an uphill battle against a system with skewed incentives. Still, they have been active for almost two decades, and keep their space open for anyone in need of equipment, space or affordable materials.
