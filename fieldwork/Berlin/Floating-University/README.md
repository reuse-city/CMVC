**Relevance for CMVC**

Even though it's not involved in the reuse of second-hand or excess materials in itself, Floating Berlin is an interesting case and quite unique to Berlin.

Floating is another of these typically Berliner initiatives that I have visited often times over the years. My last visit was part of a day of activities in April which also included a visit to [Haus der Materialisierung](../HdM). The day was organised by Professor Teresa Dillon (University of Winchester) and Thomas Charli (Ã‰NSA Versailles). Mark Jacobs from Repair Acts Bristol joined us, as well as a group of architecture students from Versailles. We were able to visit Floating and have a deep and interesting conversation with one of its founders, Rosario. Below are some of my notes during the visit.

- (initial side note for _semente_: the people for seeding and sprouting doen't need to be the same for tending and harvesting).
- My own summary here, mixing with my memory of other visits (but I suggest to check their website and other stories for more factual accounts). Floating promotes the temporary occupation of an area that receives water flowing from the Tempelhofer Feld. It used to be "maintained" in a very simplistic way. Raumlabor is an architecture company who works with the temporary occupation of spaces. Following the reintegration, Berlin had plenty of space for such experiments. Rosario used a term that I forgot to write down, but I believe it was something to the effect of transitional architecture.
- Initially the project was called Floating University indicating that they didn't only intend to have an event venue, attempt at longer term activities and research. Not an original formulation, they found after starting: there were anti-repression floating universities in Poland, similar to hedge schools in Ireland. Underground, anticolonial education. In any case, after starting they received a legal claim informing that they were forbidden to use the name *University*. They dropped the name officially, though in communication it sometimes still appears crossed out - Floating ~University~.
- Floating was home for conferences/festival like climate care, as well as plenty of smaller events over the years. They won architecture awards (Venice Biennale). The place is very interesting and innovative in its use of temporary construction. They are not allowed to build anything permanent, need to basically _float_ over the waterbed using scaffolding, wood and tarp. Quite modular - in theory, any building there can be easily disassembled and reassembled elsewhere.
- Formal experimentation.
- For some time, visitors were able to walk around the mud - they had many pairs of rubber boots available - but that was lately forbidden. They have water collection through the buildings and dry toilets. Volunteers help maintaining the place.
- A note - bureaucratic confusion over legal responsibility sometimes open space for emergent practices. It was not always clear who is responsible for the space. Senate (overall city) owns it if I understood correctly, but when it's considered a green public space, there's a dispute with the Kiez (local, sub-municipal level administration). It reminds me of Tiziana Terranova writing about the "virtual" as a stab in the weave of reality, the only way to escape total cynernetic dominance of the world. Flowers blossoming through the cracks of concrete. On the other hand, nothing there is permanent.
- Reuse on a broad sense. Additionally, they are not allowed to leave any waste in the premises, need to be radically zero waste. Intersting to reflect on things coming in and out of Floating.
- Tension between temporary / ephemeral use and acquiring roots. The needs of architects looking for the next experiment are not aligned with the desires of the surrounding communities.
