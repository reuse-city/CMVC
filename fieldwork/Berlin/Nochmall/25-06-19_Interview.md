## Interview - Nochmall

We interviewed 2 staff members (mainly one, in fact) in charge of materials sorting for [Nochmall](README.md) on 19.06.2025.

**Notes from the interview - FF**

- Idea: platform for exchange of people. For instance: work exchange for one month in Barcelona.
- Swarm intelligence.
- Non-linear education. Concrete example: actor /craftsman.
- Azubis (apprentices) learn office skills.
- Train hands. Need to learn more - design history, for example.
- Important aspect: intrinsic motivation. Potential employees need to want more than just a job. Educate inside.
- Information systems: intranet / like a wikipedia. It needs to be very specific in terms of categories.
- Sorting - decision tree: sellable / non-sellable. Non-sellable: not functional / too damaged or dirty -> refuse. 
- Sorters need to be physically resilient. Estimate that they walk 30k steps every day, and sort through 5,000 items.
- Nochmall does not take: white items, mattresses, helmets, children's seats, pressure products (cartridges etc.).
- BER - used materials.
- 60k textile items every week.
- Good value: electrical equipment, textiles, old cameras.
- [LWERK](https://lwerk-berlin.de/) helps sorting electronics (difference between Prüfen e Testen).
- Auction events, first Saturday every month.
- Important for the shop: how many times a product needs to be handled before it reaches a customer.
- Shelf time. Product tags have price and week. Role of the Abteilungsleiter to check it every 2 weeks on average. Some products can stay longer (e.g. Piano).
- Doubts about establishing online shop - may cannibalise operation and remove the social function. Not meant to sell at distance.
- Mülltrennschule.
- Profession: Einzelhandelskaufmann. Official training.
	- Cashpoint / system

## AI summary of the conversation

The store focuses on the reuse and redistribution of donated items, aiming for sustainability and a circular economy. They accept a wide range of goods, including furniture, electronics, textiles, household items, toys, and sports equipment. Items are received through donations, with 70% coming directly from individuals. The process involves sorting donated items, with an emphasis on speed due to the high volume—for instance, one person in the donation area can process approximately 5,000 items daily. Functional items are identified, while non-functional or dirty ones are noted for "splitting". They utilise an external firm for checking the functionality of electronic devices and ensure items have a "Prüfsiegel" (certification seal).

A significant aspect of the organization's work involves training and education. They educate people internally, with official titles like "Ausbilder" (trainer). The representative mentioned difficulties in training "intrinsic motivation" but attempts to guide trainees by sharing their experience and resources like a "library of furniture history". Ideal candidates for training are described as having good communication skills, physical stress resilience, and the ability to work consciously.

They offer training for professions such as "Einzelhandels Kaufmann" (retail merchant). The representative, who will be leaving the organization in a month, has selected a colleague as their "Nachfolger" (successor) and sales manager, indicating a key role in the organisation.

The organization's departments include office management, HR, truck drivers, storage management, and specific categories like furniture, electronics, textiles, and household goods. They also facilitate upcycling workshops and a "repair cafe" where people can fix non-functional electronic devices.

The organization faces several operational challenges. A major issue is the sheer volume of donated textiles, which they lack the time to wash, clean, or fix, making it uneconomical. Selling certain items, particularly office or expensive designer furniture, can be difficult, leading to long shelf times. Storage architecture is also noted as a problem.

The representative highlighted the importance of a controlled process for receiving items, contrasting it with cities like Frankfurt where people leave furniture on the street, which can lead to damage from rain or vandalism.

The representative envisions broader systemic changes towards a more sustainable consumption model. They advocate for a shift from constant buying to a model where consumers pay for transactions, suggesting concepts like unconditional basic income. They also discussed the potential for an international platform for educational exchange. The organization seeks to educate consumers and contribute to a better world on both a small and large scale. They also explore innovative ideas like a "declutter app" for recycling. Despite the challenges, including rising electricity prices, the representative hopes to increase the store's exposure.
