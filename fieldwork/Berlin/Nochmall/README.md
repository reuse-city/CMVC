Nochmall is a large second-hand store connected to the local waste authority, BSR. It is well-organised and clean. Nochmall receives donations coming from the [BSR Kieztage](https://www.bsr.de/mein-sperrmuell-kieztag-30414.php) and direct donations brought by the population. The store has regular repair cafés and other activities.

I visited Nochmall again yesterday and had a short but very good chat with a staff member. We agreed to schedule a longer conversation for the near future. During the few minutes I was there, I had an initial overview of their sorting area. They receive private donations directly on containers outside the store and sort them on the spot. There are boxes for different kinds of materials. He talked a bit about books and stressed how fast a decision has to be made. If I understood correctly, every couple of weeks they fill a 10m³ container with unusable materials that are then sent to BSR. Not surprisingy, he said that fast fashion is a big problem. I learnt that textiles are sent to another facility ("10 min away") to be sorted and then brought back. He also said that they don't offer many electronics, which seems to be a missed opportunity to increase revenue but would likely require its own infrastructure.

Anonymous observation visit. It's my third or fourth time at Nochmall. It always gives this impression of a neatly organised space, with clearly defineed roles. On the one hand, it makes it easy to understand how to navigate the store and whom to ask if I have doubts. In my experience, staff members are always nice and open, as if they're happy to interact, discuss prices, etc. One example: two girls were checking a piece of furniture and accidentally dropped a part made of glass. A staff member came up immediately and made them feel like it was no problem. He said "you don't need to buy it, don't worry". One of the girls insisted that she actually wanted, and the guy offered a discount since a piece would be missing. Everyone around seemed to feel happy about it.

On the other hand, the clearly defined roles is completely different from other reuse initiatives I have seen over the years, in that I didn't feel invited to be part. I was there as a potential consumer, not as a potential member. The care I owe to the space is the same care I am required in just any shop, or at least any shop I am well treated in. But there is no sense of building community. Clients don't come as a demonstration of solidarity or engagement with the purpose or mission. On the contrary, I felt as though people were playing a game of discovery, expecting to find objects that were worth more than the price tag, or solving their own problems instead of helping reduce waste in the city. I also wondered about a sort of class dynamics taking place, like the many shops I know in Brazil where whose managers and owners don't purchase what they sell.

I'm reminded of the systems of circularity I encountered for instance in Nantes or Dundee, where reuse shops were also spaces of socialisation. What if Nochmall was a solidarity-economy based cooperative instead of a for-profit venture? What if neighbourhood cooperatives were entitled to be formed and collect donations locally? Is there any legal impediment for that in terms of product ownership, perhaps?

There was a repair cafe going on upstairs. It looked very organised (perhaps too much, for my taste). Some people sat patiently, apparently waiting for their turn. The expert-looking repairers nicely attended to one person at a time, and really dedicated their time to try and repair the guests' equipments. But there was no festive vibe, no experimentation, no collaborative knowledge being developed on-site. And that is arguably OK, although I again felt this clear distance and a sort of service-oriented organisation. On the short time I was there watching, I saw portable radios and appliances. 

Overall, the store is welcoming (despite being hard to reach from where I live, and arguably easier if one has a car). It seems to battle to find the swee spot between affordability and the need to achieve financial break even.
