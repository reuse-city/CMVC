Nochmall is a large second-hand store connected to the local waste authority, BSR. It is well-organised and clean. Nochmall receives donations coming from the [BSR Kieztage](https://www.bsr.de/mein-sperrmuell-kieztag-30414.php) and direct donations brought by the population. The store has regular repair cafés and other activities.

I visited Nochmall again yesterday and had a short but very good chat with a staff member. We agreed to schedule a longer conversation for the near future. During the few minutes I was there, I had an initial overview of their sorting area. They receive private donations directly on containers outside the store and sort them on the spot. There are boxes for different kinds of materials. He talked a bit about books and stressed how fast a decision has to be made. If I understood correctly, every couple of weeks they fill a 10m³ container with unusable materials that are then sent to BSR. Not surprisingy, he said that fast fashion is a big problem. I learnt that textiles are sent to another facility ("10 min away") to be sorted and then brought back. He also said that they don't offer many electronics, which seems to be a missed opportunity to increase revenue but would likely require its own infrastructure.
