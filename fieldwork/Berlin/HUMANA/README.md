# HUMANA

HUMANA Kleidersammlung is a social business collecting, sorting and shipping donated textiles. It is not as well-known as its sister organisation, confusingly also called HUMANA - the [chain of second-hand clothes shops](https://www.humana-second-hand.de/) from Germany and expanding to other European countries.

As part of the [Lange Nacht der Textilretter](https://a-gain.guide/de/lange-nacht-der-textilretter), I went to a guided visit to the HUMANA sorting center in the outskirts of Berlin (in fact, it's right after one of the borders with Brandenburg, near the Hoppegarten S-Bahn Station). It was a Friday evening, and I joined a small group of people there to see the facility. We were hosted by one person who has been working with HUMANA for decades and is quite proud of their history and achievements.

They have a wide warehouse, pretty well structured for logistics. Lorries bring a high volume of clothes every day (if I wrote it correctly, they have ~700 collection points in Berlin, and the sister organisation has around 20 second-hand shops). The clothes are put in trolleys, and then brought to the sorters who work upstairs. Each sorter has a workstation with a number of destination boxes (I counted five main categories, in addition to 3 or 4 smaller ones for less frequent types). On the other side there is a conveyor belt. Products sent to the destination boxes fall through holes directly on specific boxes downstairs for each category (for instance thick winter, summer, all-year, wool). On those boxes, sorters will only put clothes considered good for sale on German/European shops. Pieces that need repair but are on a good shape are sent to another box to be sent to Pakistan, where our host says there is a significant repair sector that can fix garments and resell them locally. And those goods not worth selling in Europe nor repaired in Pakistan but still in good condition are put in the conveyor belt, to be exported in bales to African countries - chiefly South Africa. 

HUMANA collects materials in curbside donation containers, as well as the HUMANA shops. Recent changes in EU legislation caused misunderstanding in Germany. As far as I understood, this is the situation: because textiles are now considered recyclable materials, people have been putting unusable clothes in the donation boxes since the beginning of 2025. Our host reported that the proportion of such materials doubled, also because other actors stopped collecting (I had noticed already that some donation containers had disappeared from spots I knew in Friedrichshain, for instance). HUMANA needs to pay to discard the materials not deemed good to be sold, so this arguable contamination of unusable clothes significantly impacts their operation.

Training of the sorters is usually a 6-month long process. In the first month, they will work in tandem with a more experienced professional. After that, they usually take another 5 months to pick up their pace. In our visit, we could observe one staff member working. She spends ony a few seconds with each pieace of garment. Part of the assessment needs to rely on her experiential and embodied knowledge - her hands need to be as sharp as her eyes. If I got it right, each sorter will go through up to one tonne of clothes per day. They work 8-hour shifts (there are 2 shifts: 6-14 and 14-22) with 3 breaks each. The turnover is reportedly very low - on average, the current staff has 8 years there, including the drivers. In the case of sorters, it's even longer. The one we were observing has been working with them for 26 years. A board in one of the walls gives tips of desirable styles, suggested by shop managers that come from time to time. During a visit, the board explained that the trend in 2024 was "Y2K + Indie Sleaze".

After the visit we had a chance to make further questions and discuss the context in which they operate. They expect the EPR regulations will be beneficial to the field, and help pay costs. VAT exemptions were also mentioned as potentially advantageous.
