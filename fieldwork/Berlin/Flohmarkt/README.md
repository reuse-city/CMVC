# Flohmarkt

Berlin has many famous flea markets going on since decades. Just to name a few of the regular ones, typically happening on Sundays: RAW Gelände, Neukölln Flowmarkt, Mauerpark, Boxi. There are also ad-hoc markets in homes and community centres, schools and Kitas.

## Notes by FF

I recently had a stall at the Mauerpark Flohmarkt to sell personal belongings as I moved to a new home, and used the opportunity to reflect on some impressions.

I went to the market one week in advance to book my stall. I paid 35 EUR to secure a place and was shown its location on an A4 map. On the day, I arrived there in the morning to set it up and paid another 15 to the staff assembling the stalls. It was on a different spot, but I didn't care.

It was nominally Spring already, but I was unlucky to get a very cold Sunday. That made me notice even more the seasonality, on multiple levels. Firstly, the weather has an effect on how many people actually go out to a flea market on a Sunday, for how long they circulate, and how eager they are for instance to try on clothes. Additionally, the season has an effect on the types of products sellers offer and buyers expect to find. That's obvious regarding clothes, but also impacts electrical appliances, outdoor gear and sport equipment.

Even though all products brought to the stalls are expected to change hands, they are typically nowhere near end of life. That reinforces the critique to the usual ways of framing industrial lifecycle under a linear paradigm (manufacturer - user - discard). The 'user' should be depicted as a loop that slowly spirals onto itself, extending the use time of a product as much as possible. On that matter, maintenance is paramount. Obviously, well-maintained products can be used for longer and will arguably obtain a better price on a flea market (even though there are many other variables impacting the price). 

In deciding what to bring to a flea market, there are many caclulations to make. What should I in fact bring? How much space will each object take on my stall? Can I get a better price selling it online through Kleinanzeigen, eBay or Facebook Marketplace? Should I wait until the next season or a warmer day? Logistic considerations - is it easy to carry? Do I have a car, or a cart, or does it have wheels? Can I fit it on a rolling suitcase? Does the object need assembly? If I don't sell it, is it easy to bring back home?

Should I fix prices and stick to them throughout the market, stay firm against offers? Or should I be completely flexible and decide prices on the spot, depending on the vibe I get from the potential buyer? The cold day suggests people won't be staying around the market and come back a second time, but what is the consequence? Does it mean that if I don't lower the price they're not coming back, or that they will want to get deals done faster and go home? There's also an aspect of understanding the materiality, what things are made of, what is their value. The price is never objective.
