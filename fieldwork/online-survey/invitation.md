Online Survey - Circular Valuers (for the reuse of goods and materials)

The citizen science project Circular Material Valuer Curriculum aims to understand the skills, experience, and sensibility needed to give a longer life to the increasing amount of discarded or unused goods. We invite you to contribute to this important goal by participating in our online survey. Your input will directly help us identify better ways to divert reusable goods and materials from becoming waste through repair, upcycling, adaptation, and recirculation.

You can find more information and access the survey through the links below:
