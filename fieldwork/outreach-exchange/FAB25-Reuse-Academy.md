Reuse Academy: how to reuse (almost) anything

**Summary**

This talk unveils Reuse Academy: a project developed from my "Generous Cities" research, investigating how we can transition from a linear "take-make-dispose" model to circular, community-based systems. We'll delve into the potential of repair, upcycling, and material re-circulation to create more just and sustainable urban environments, with a focus on practical strategies and collaborative action.

**Detailed information**

This talk presents the "Reuse Academy", a pioneer project to empower community-based circular economy practices. Born from the "Generous Cities" PhD research, the project addresses our need to move beyond "take-make-dispose." We'll explore how the maker principles of hands-on learning can drive a reuse revolution. A key role is to enable with tools and technology the "Circular Material Valuers" â€“ skilled professionals guiding discarded goods back into use.

The talk will outline how Reuse Academy can:

- Foster a global network.
- Develop open-source reuse curricula.
- Position fab labs as repair/upcycling hubs.
- Help build "Generous Cities" that value resourcefulness.

The talk is a call to action for makers to lead in creating a more sustainable future based on materials readily available everywhere in the world.
