Designing the Reuse Economy: Material Valuer Skills

**Summary**

This workshop explores how makers can drive a circular economy through reuse. We'll define the "Circular Material Valuer" â€“ a key role in assessing & revaluing discarded goods. Participants will identify skills needed for this work and ideate on fab/maker oriented initiatives on the topic. 

**Detailed information**

Fab labs are hubs for innovation, but how can we apply making skills to address the growing challenge of waste? This workshop delves into the concept of the "Circular Material Valuer" and its relevance for a reuse-oriented future.
    
The "Circular Material Valuer Curriculum" project highlights the need for professionals who can effectively divert reusable goods from the waste stream. This requires a blend of:
    
- Material Analysis: Identifying components & potential.
- Social Awareness: Understanding community needs.
- Economic Evaluation: Creating value & opportunities.
- Environmental Responsibility: Prioritizing reuse.
    
Participants will:
    
- Define the role's skills & knowledge.
- Analyse limitations of current waste systems.
- Discuss the role of fab labs in supporting Valuers.
    
We'll explore how makerspaces and fablabs can become key players in a circular economy, going beyond making new things to re-making our relationship with resources.
