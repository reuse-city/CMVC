# Notes by Felipe

From the [second online session](README.md).

## Highlights

- Storage is often a considerable obstacle for local circular business models. Most big cities don't have enough affordable space for organisations to store and exchange second-hand goods and parts.
- Automation of assessment would lead to lowest common denominator - reduces value.
- Problem with incentives for reusing.

## Notes taken during the session

A Local Economies website - started with contents from the [MAkE](https://globalinnovationgathering.org/make/) project - open catalogue of business models for makerspaces and small-scale manufacturing.

Interviewed 50 or so makespce leaders. Some ORGs in the ecosystem. Understand and abstract. 17 business models.

There's no ideal business model for all makerspaces, as the objective is the community. So diverse that there's not a best answer. Creating buffet of options. People can come to alternative revenue streams. 

One business model called recycling. [Circular economy aspects](https://localeconomies.org/manufacturingbusinessmodel-category/circular-economy/) coming to many of the others.

F asks: Material Valuer as profession?

A Yes. I haven't come up with it, but since you said it - it's valuable. Think of individual profession / aspect of business model. 

Material valuation // material storage.

Started with a recycling makerspace in south london - [remakery](https://www.remakery.org/). Donations of wood, construction materials. Sort them and store until they use.  Matching sypply and demand.

Material valuation - recognise that as something that's needed. 

F asks - where do people learn from? Where in the world are valuers active?

A Interested in creating way to visually show value added by material valuers. Waste stream. Talking yesterday with J in Accra. Price per container load - mixed textiles of used clothes.

Accra. Bales. Garments. Repaired. Pay to send to landfill. 

F asks - technology? Hand, tactile knowledge. Hard to digitalise as replacement. Tailors, hand, embodied knowledge.

A Value chain. Role of material valuers.

Challenge of automation - lowest common denominator. It often reduces value. Vastly incrases time needed to reuse.

Visited a PCB recycling facility. Ground up PCBs and take them through filtration tanks. Problem with automation is reducing to standardise and make it recognisable. Whilst there's a lot of real value of reuse of materials. Reuse without breaking them down further.

Existing professions (craft, tailors) have a business incentive.

Social perception is more of a challenge. 

Repair workers. Allied into that. More maker knowledge. Small scale manufacturing. What things can be - what additional parts. 

F asks intersection between fields (makers, craft, recycling). Differences on a global scale.

A making spare parts. Skills applied to repairs.

S value systems that we have. Industrial-level narrative. Automated to the point of dealing with things en masse. Gap in that kind of thinking. Tend to think about proecesses and materials. Recycling - 2 different meanings. Deviation. Sinergies. Reprap... manufacturers saw 3d printers as cute, but not real thing. We always saw them differently. 

That potential is being realised, though. What value systems would recognise it? From hobbyists - home-based. Disparity to scale. Even though the technology has potential. Seen that with assistive devices - customisation of objects would not happen otherwise. But it's the tip of the iceberg.

Gap between what it means recycling process. City level. Local innovations shouted out. 

G digital and sustainability last year - writing papers. Some of the discussions were around the point of how introducing CE processes could disadvantage global south. Resource exploitation and work in developing countries. Make everybody poorer? Hard way to explain and argue that locally against global scenario. Little understanding of global effects. 

F asks - for material valuers, should environemtal consideration be part of training or that's a given? IOW, are the people interested in becoming valuers already sensible to environmental topics?

A - in Accra for instance, people are not necessarily aware. Some are into it because of environmnetal awareness. But many see it as a means to support themselves and family.

G drove to BSR Hof. Had a brokem chair. Guy insisted to send in the furniture press. 

S  you have a machine and a missing plastic piece. If you're able to 3d print it. Gap is access to 3d printing. Not everybody knows how to make a 3d model. 

A bespoke ppoach in temrs of skills. People with the skills to recognise what can go where. 

Filtered stream - this can get repaired. 

[Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG7FkgNX6Fc) from an EU project. [POP machina](https://pop-machina.eu/). 

F - interesting - [IAAC was involved](https://iaac.net/projects/pop-machina/). *PS.: [results page on Cordis](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/821479/results
).*

F ask about human-centred approach to tech. Not to replace labour, but help improving work.

G yesterday BMU - reuse recycling related topics. What kind of digital resources? EU-wide repair platform to match services. 

Automation in some areas would be hardware scanners - textile label. This or that? Spectrometer?

Second step is what to do with it. Where do I go find. Different levels. Missing parts for it. Connecting knowledge bases that are out there. 

A also health and safety. Horrific ways of recyling things.

Another thought. Half memory of value chain project in East Africa. Trying to bring kowledge of international commodity prices to small-holder farmers. 

F asks class identity. Also on international prices: Brazil, Aluminium recycling, industry promotes the country as champion but it's precarious labour dependent on international commodity prices.

G what space does city have? In-between use.

F Berlin [HdM](../../Berlin/HdM). Long-term storage is challenging. Big cities don't have space for that.

G shopping malls?

F reuse superstore Berlin - [Nochmall](../../Berlin/Nochmall) connected?

S Jupiter Mall in Hamburg. Abandoned. Transformed, Fab Lab. Pop-up. Talking about coops and reused materials and Fab on site. Temporary thing. Brilliant as rest of the space was used for small businesses. Cafe, handmade products, people making a lot of their products themselves. Great way for the city to keep building.

Singapore is all about shopping malls. There's no space. In Japan, though, Tokyo  - Muji store. Products from design perspective. Desirable  "IKEA of Japan". Doing 3d printing on-site, using materials from produts that they make. Commonly thrown away. Boxes - files on shelf. That product is shredded. Muji circular. Concept store in a huge mall. 

A charity shops in UK? Volunteers. Everything is donated. Sell as it is. Large scale in the UK.

F yes, interested also in the bin outside of charity shops - what part of discard could still be usable?

S (after we stopped recording) Links. [Electronics reuse](https://whatareyoudoing.sg/bridging-the-digital-divide-one-tech-device-at-a-time/) and [assessment/repair workflow](https://salvage.garden/remakeit-workshops-2/).
