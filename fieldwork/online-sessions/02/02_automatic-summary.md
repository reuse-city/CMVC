This second online session of the "Circular Material Valuer Curriculum Project" (CMVC) on May 14, 2025, focused on business models related to material reuse, repair, and upcycling, and how these connect to local economies.

Participant 1 began by discussing the "local economies.org" website, created from the "MAKE" project. This website provides an open catalog of 17 business models for maker spaces and small-scale manufacturing, developed from interviews with approximately 50 maker space leaders. The goal is to offer a "buffet of options" for sustainability, as no single ideal business model exists due to diverse community needs and objectives. While only one business model is dedicated solely to recycling, circular economy aspects are integrated into many others. Participant 1 strongly believes "material valuing" can be considered a profession or a key aspect of a business model, recognizing it as a crucial value-adding activity for any recycling effort. She highlighted the "remakery" in South London, a recycling maker space that sorted and stored donated construction waste, demonstrating how material storage often complements material valuation by bridging the time gap between material acquisition and reuse. Participant 1 suggested creating a visual language to explain the value chains and the role of material valuers in deciding where materials go and how much value is added. She shared an example of textile waste in Accra, where mixed textiles are sorted by traders, with some portions requiring payment for landfill disposal due to poor quality.

Participant 2 noted that the high volume of materials, as seen in Berlin's Humana and Nochmall sorting facilities, makes automation difficult for material evaluation. He emphasized that human hands and experience are crucial for identifying details that cameras cannot, making full automation currently impossible. Participant 2 also questioned how different established professions, such as tailors or electronics repair persons, could contribute knowledge to material evaluation. He suggested that while these professions have expertise in material assessment, their training often lacks environmental and social considerations regarding extending material lifetimes.

Participant 1 agreed that automation often reduces material value by forcing standardization, making it harder to reuse items without further breakdown. She stressed the continued need for manual evaluation, possibly with technological assistance for pre-filtering. Regarding existing professions, Participant 1 suggested that business incentives could drive repair workers to figure out how to reuse items, even without explicit social value considerations. She highlighted that repair workers already possess the skills to assess repairability and that adding "maker knowledge" about locally fabricating new parts (like 3D printing a broken plastic latch) could significantly enhance the repair value chain. Participant 3 reiterated the disparity between industrial-level narratives focused on mass automation and the maker/fab lab approach. He argued that open-source machines for repurposing parts are often dismissed by large enterprises. He gave examples of 3D printers enabling custom-made assistive devices at a lower cost than factories, and pointed out the gap in human skills for 3D modeling, despite increasing affordability of 3D printing technology.

The discussion then shifted to global differences in maker culture, with Participant 2 citing Brazil's experience where the import of "maker culture" from the US sometimes distanced itself from local reuse practices. Participant 4 highlighted how the introduction of circular economy processes could disadvantage Global South countries if not implemented globally with localized processes. The group also discussed the ethical challenges of highly precarious work in material recycling, such as Brazil's aluminum recycling industry, which is highly dependent on fluctuating international commodity prices. Participant 2 emphasized that a focus on pure profit in reuse businesses might divert from environmental impact, suggesting that acknowledging the environmental service performed by material valuers could foster a professional identity and class solidarity.

The conversation then explored the role of technology in assisting, rather than replacing, human labor in material evaluation. Participant 4 mentioned discussions in the German Ministry of Environment about a European-wide repair platform and a chat tool for self-guided repair. She envisioned material valuers using hardware like spectrometers to identify unknown materials and chat assistants to guide them to knowledge resources for resale, repair, or missing parts. Participant 1 emphasized incorporating health and safety aspects into training and technology to prevent hazardous practices seen in some informal recycling operations. She also suggested making international commodity prices accessible to grassroots waste pickers to help them maximize their income.

The issue of storage was revisited, with Participant 1 noting that charity shops in the UK effectively provide buffering storage for seasonal items, allowing them to capture more value from donations. The challenge of finding sufficient space in cities for such "in-between" use was discussed, with Participant 2 mentioning a precarious current arrangement for the "Circular House" project in Berlin and Participant 4 suggesting using empty shopping malls. Participant 3 provided examples of repurposing abandoned spaces in Hamburg for a Fab City popup and a Muji store in Tokyo that recycles its own products on-site.

The session concluded with Participant 1 suggesting that charity shops in the UK offer valuable insights into material valuation, especially with volunteers performing tasks like PAT testing and basic repairs on electronics. Participant 2 acknowledged the relevance of charity shops but emphasized the project's current focus on the first level of material evaluation: identifying items that can be immediately resold, those needing minor interventions, and those requiring deeper repair. He also expressed future plans to develop a "repair 101" course to establish basic repair principles applicable across various fields.
