# Notes by Felipe

From the [first online session](README.md).


## Highlights

- Difference between repair and reuse - intention to continue using thing. Value is inherent.
- Prepare to reuse
- Repair as resistance against de-valuing
- Current economy and flows of materials simplify the linear economy and put wrong incentives
- Waiting and giving the right time for a repair makes the object lose value
- Collection points adjacent to recycling centres
- Sorting is not only about goods/materials, but also mapping / generating data
	- types of materials typical in each collection point / over time
	- potential beneficiaries
- Sort and quick redirect to balance need and offer
- System-wide business that treats the value of a product as the value of avoiding waste


**Idea:** separate course/curriculum to educate recycling managers (and/or waste authority staff) to create projects about compliance with EU waste directives (waste priority on tthe first Rs; circular economy; ecodesign).

## Notes taken during the session

**Ugo**

There is one big clarification needed. What we mean with different terms. When we talk about repair, differentiate repair vs reuse. Policy is expansive and inclusive. For us the distinction is necessary becasue value stems from someone gives it value.

Own it. And expects to continue to extend life.

Second life.

You intend to continue using that thing. No question as to the value. Gigantic difference.

13 years doing. Realisation was recent, after visiting large project in Manchester. Big hub where materials separated at recycle and reuse centers in the city are sorted into skiffs and brought to be prepared for reuse.

Community repair does not need to be that selective.

If you have 2 or 20 vacuum cleaners - 18 have only scratches. Cost time and/or money to fix. Likely to discard the 2. There's an infinite amount of reusable stuff. Devalued / revalued. Establish value. Compare to the ones that require less additional work.

Big part of the repair movement's ultimate value is not only learning that repair is possible and desirable. Ultimate act of resistance towards things losing value. If there is a sweater or a par of jeans that is kind of run down but mine - whether I fix or someone fixes for me, doesn't matter. Community repair movement and low cost commercial repair.

Intentional decision to extend the lifetime - you decide. But you realise that if not you other people won't choose to repair. Dynamics of charity shop. Doesnt' need to have the pocket resown. 

Provocation about ways to give value. Other projecs that are not at the same scale - recyclings vs reuse. Much more community focus. The scale of potentially discarded things that need realocation is the scary part.

Huge flows - how to counter them? Amount of time needed to fix something up. 


Very much northern privileged perspective. Scarcity plays a big role in other parts of the world.

Set up shop in the recycling centre in London and quickly flooded with laptops that people discard as EOL - put in this box instead and we'll sort what can be reused. Very easy to be massively ovverwhelmed with componentes and in theory have.

**FF asks about ownership and liability in the UK**

Products that don't have personal data could be excluded from complicated workflows. That's lesess of an issue. Onus is not on the original owner to ensure that there's no data theft. 

Implications on safety - reuse of things particularly if the product is re-sold - liability of who ever has sold the product that might be defective or leading to damage or injury. There is a lot of caution. PAT testing. Visual inspection. 

People could be illegally removing from e-waste treatment and lead to illlegal exports.

Qualification or exemption to take for charitable purposes or not.

Very elegant way around ownership regulations - collection areas that are adjacent to waste facilities - just outside recycling centres. Things do not become waste.


**FF asks about skills and experience and knowledge - extending to decentralised reuse/repair**

Decentralised would be the way to go. With caveat, unequal collection of materials. Rebalance. One of the key values of people in that sector is not only sort through but also the mapping of potential beneficiary groups and organisations. Trying to limit the accumulation in one individual space of too many things. Quick turnover to where things are more needed.

For everything - grading . Ongoing act of figuring out potential to be reutilised. In this phase given the amount of materials involved it's probably impossible to think of zero waste scenario.

Hypothesis - if you go sufficiently small in decentralisation - higher chance to reduce outtakes.

**FF asks - Zero Waste + Fabcity + Repair and reuse in the 15-min city**

Thing that might just have cosmetic defect - look less good but functionality is ok. How to decide if a small repair is justifiable? If not, per type of product, what would be the most valuable component to be kept in use as such instead of using the entire product? That's a lot of information. Decentralisation in a geographic sense is part of this. But also decentralisation of product type. 

Audio products vs kitchen-type products. Certain types of components. Instead of expecting people to have skills that cut across.
Some people focus on particular types of things. 

**FF shows images from previous research ([Value](https://github.com/reuse-city/CMVC/blob/main/background/value.png), [Private/Public](https://github.com/reuse-city/CMVC/blob/main/background/private-public.png), asks about storage.**

There's space and there's time. Sometimes a repair requires to store things for longer. For people who do that as a hobby there's an element of deciding on timing. Had people really upset about availability of spare parts. Partly addresed by legislation and clearly partly not. Perceived scarcity of parts for certain products that are not actively commercialised or distributed anymore. Prodct A with rare part you need to fix - availability and demand is reduced. Cost of procuring the part increases. Wasted. Things should be available at a low price point. Value of the product is the value of avoiding waste. But most business models around this don't see it that way - other costs. Reducing chances that the product will ever be repaired. In parallel, explosion of marketplaces for refurbished products. Approaching repair, need to take into account that it might be more expensive to repair the one you own compared to reurbished. Happened - recently: Wii console - too many disks inside. Disk drive. Repair would cost something like 30 EUR - buying secondhand, 20 + keep existing parts for the future. Other factors that would modify economic valiue. How do we give value to certain things.

Repair voucher pilot in Berlin - interesting. Gave people going themselves to repair cafe the chance to have a full refund. 

Model of group in Brighton - decide which computers and mobile phones to prioritise for reuse. Opened shop in high street that was designed to help give value to things. Stuff available there with indicative price and people could pay what they thought was worth. Trying to create workflow that takes into account what aspects.

Skillset curriculum. There's a gap definitely. Witnessed in the UK. Operatives in recycling centres - level of understanding of the potential reuse as products instead of just materials. Particularly older generation. People that don't seem to value.

Manchester. Industrial operation. 

Large project EU funded including recycling company in Italy that is creating a model around disassembling washing machines to the spare parts can be used for new cheaper ones.
