On April 30, 2025, the first online session of the "Circular Material Valuer Curriculum Project," or CMVC, took place. The goal of the session was to begin developing strategies for the project and to incorporate the experiences of various participants.

The discussion focused on how materials can be evaluated, specifically secondhand or discarded items, or things people keep unused but wish to re-purpose. The discussion touched upon situations where these materials are stored or used in organized reuse projects.

A key topic was the assessment of materials for potential reuse, especially in contexts like restart parties and repair fairs. Participant 1 was asked to share their experiences, including with a project in London, and to compare differences in practices between the UK, EU, and other parts of the world they had visited. The conversation also considered policy, regulation, and legislation, and how these factors might hinder or help the reuse of materials and the assessment of their potential value.

Participant 2 suggested focusing on a "first layer of evaluation" as a step toward building a "reuse academy" that would include various projects related to the articulation and education of material reuse. The immediate focus of the CMVC project is to understand potential ways to reuse materials.

Participant 1 emphasized the distinction between repairing and reusing. They stated that in community repair activities, the value of an object comes from the owner's continued interest in extending its life, meaning there's no question about its value. This differs significantly from large-scale material aggregation centers where discarded items, already devalued, require re-establishing their value, which often leads to discarding items that need more work. They highlighted that the repair movement's value lies in preventing items from losing value.

The discussion also touched upon the legal aspects of ownership and liability when dealing with discarded items, particularly electronics, in the UK. Participant 1 explained that personal data on devices is often used to discourage or forbid the extraction of items from recycling centers. Additionally, concerns about safety and liability for potentially defective products are reasons for caution, leading to procedures like "PAT testing" and visual inspections to ensure safety before reuse, especially if products are sold. They suggested that having collection areas outside recycling centers, where items are clearly donated rather than discarded as waste, could circumvent some of these issues.

Participant 2 outlined the project's purpose: to help organizations improve material reuse, moving beyond superficial assessments. The aim is for an initial sorting layer to direct items needing cleaning, simple repairs, or recontextualization for reuse. They proposed that cities develop decentralized reuse strategies, where local centers (community centers, reuse centers) would be equipped with the knowledge and skills for deeper sorting, reducing the need to send all materials to large industrial sorting facilities.

Participant 1 agreed that decentralization is the only way to manage the volume of discarded items, with the caveat that some areas might accumulate more and need to offload elsewhere. They emphasized the importance of mapping potential beneficiary groups and organizations to limit accumulation and ensure a quick turnover of materials to where they are most needed. They identified three levels of assessment: cosmetic issues, justifiable small repairs, and identifying valuable components from products that can't be fully reused.

The conversation explored decentralization by product type, suggesting that specialized skills for specific product categories (e.g., audio products vs. kitchen appliances) could speed up processes. The lack of exchange between different repair and reuse communities was noted, as was the lack of incentives and rewards for reuse compared to the linear economy's incentives.

The idea of a "15-minute repair" was discussed, extending the concept of a "15-minute city" to repair and reuse, so that services are locally available. Obstacles to commercial repair on a local scale were acknowledged.

Participant 2 shared insights from their research, highlighting different scales of value in repair (low-end materials not worth repairing, high-end products with professional services, and consumer brands that are repairable with learning). They also noted differences in expectations when repairing in private versus community settings, and the impact of storage availability on the feasibility of repair and reuse.

Participant 1 added that the scarcity and increasing cost of spare parts for older products hinder repair, creating a "wasted scenario" where parts should be cheap to prevent waste but are not. They also pointed out the dilemma where repairing an item can be more expensive than buying a refurbished secondhand unit of the same product.

The Berlin repair fund pilot trial was mentioned as an interesting policy attempt, offering full refunds for spare parts in community repair settings and 50% discounts for commercial repairs, but also noting issues with its complexity and potential for misuse.

The discussion concluded with future plans, including an upcoming conversation with Anna about business models for openness and maker spaces. Participant 1 offered to connect Participant 2 with Suez UK to learn about their training for staff at the Manchester hub, which integrates reuse thinking into industrial operations. The possibility of educational interventions for managers in waste authorities was also raised, to shift their focus from just recycling and incineration to prioritizing reuse and waste prevention in line with EU legislation.
