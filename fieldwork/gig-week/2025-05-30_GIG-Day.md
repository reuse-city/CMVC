# 2025-05-30 GIG Day

In the last day of the GIG week, we had an open conversation around topics of reuse, making and circularity. A summary of the conversation is below (generated by NotebookLM based on the audio recording of the session).

*   There was a discussion highlighting a **similarity or parallel between digital maker/fab skills and operations performed outside of those digital worlds**.
*   A topic bookmarked for potential future discussion is the idea of having a **shared infrastructure for educational projects**, noting existing parallel activities in providing educational resources and online courses.
*   A key idea behind the Circular Material Valuer Curriculum project is to **revisit the discussion from the early days of maker culture** (around 2006-2007) about **making products that could be extended and eternally reused**. It is noted that there was later a shift in focus towards prototyping for mass production.
*   The conversation touches upon the future potential influenced by circular economy regulations such as the **Waste Framework Directive** (which prioritises reuse over recycling and incineration), the **Circular Economy Action Plan for Europe**, **Right to Repair legislation**, and **ecodesign directives**. While these are hoped to reduce environmental harm in the future, the volume of waste materials being discarded is currently increasing daily.
*   The concept of a **"reuse academy"** is introduced, aimed at connecting **repair people, craftspeople, and digital making** to learn how discarded materials can be used as source materials, moving beyond typical maker space supplies.
*   The idea of viewing the **city as a maker space** is mentioned, recognising that every small town and city possesses equipment, skills, and knowledge of the territory and local materials. An example is given of a small town in Brazil spending a significant portion of its municipal budget on exporting waste that could potentially be reused locally.
*   The term "waste" is preferred to be used as a verb rather than a noun.
*   The concept of **"systems of generosity"** is preferred over "systems of abundance," as generosity is seen as intentional.
*   A primary goal of the initial stage of the project is to understand **how to train people to identify items that can still be reused**.
*   References and information on how to educate people about the possibilities of reusing discarded materials are welcomed. [Tim Hunkin](https://timhunkin.com/) is suggested as a potential source with a [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtaR0lZhSyANYB0Xxb9OSp47pHuQmj3Ol).
*   The discussion includes the **social value** of reusing objects, such as donating them to NGOs that work with children from disadvantaged backgrounds who cannot afford these items.
*   The concept of **repurposing** is explored, using the example of transforming a discarded item into a material installation for a music studio.
*   A challenge noted is the need for a **fast selection process** to identify reusable materials, especially when organisations receive large quantities of items, limiting the time available for deep analysis of their potential use.
