I've known KK and followed their work since I met one of the members in [MotionLab](https://motionlab.berlin/de/) in 2021. They create large-scale interactive artworks and installations, drawing heavily on reused/recycled materials.

Their headquarters is located a short walk out of Grefswalder Str S-Bahn station. It is both a workshop and an event venue. They are located in [Diskobabel](https://diskobabel.de/), an area also hosting clubs and an independent circus called [Zirkus Mond](https://www.zirkusmond.de/).

I visited the place a number of times over the years, and was there recently to chat about CMVC. My contact said that having access to materials is getting harder in Berlin lately.
