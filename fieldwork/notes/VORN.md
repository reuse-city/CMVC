**Relevance to CMVC**

Hub dedicated to sustainable fashion and part of the [Make-a-thek project with GIG](https://globalinnovationgathering.org/2025/03/12/make-a-thek-launched/).


## Notes by FF

### 06.05.2025 

I joined Make-a-thek's launch event last week (28/04) and ended up co-facilitating one of the discussion groups with participants after a colleague from Circular Berlin had to leave. The discussion topic was "materials and sourcing", which also connects to the CMVC project. Below are my comments about the session.

---

The discussion was structured along three questions:

- What is missing? (hardware, networks, skills, places)
- What is working? (what approaches can we build on?)
- How can we integrate people through libraries?

#### What is missing?

It's arguably predictable that any discussion about innovative approaches to sustainable and circular materials sourcing would inevitably mention the need for _money_ and _partners_. It is widely acknowledged that the incentive systems under the current global economic systems favour linear, unsustainable and inhumane manufacturing. Sourcing materials for circular fashion would certainly benefit from the availability of financial resources to counterbalance that condition.

The mention to partners as something that is not working is curious, though, since different stakeholders active in circularity are usually open to collaborations and partnerships. That take relates to the perceived lack of a _network of makers for workshops_, an indicative of _fragmentation_. On the other hand, participants also pointed _accessibility to machines_ as being problematic - while aware that machines do exist in Berlin, some reported that it's hard to have access to them as an individual not connected to institutions or brands. Someone suggested there should be _mobile machines for sharing_ between different areas and communities. 

Interestingly, none of the keywords described in the paragraph above is directly connected to sourcing and materials proper. On that theme, there were interesting comments. One participant said that finding _used textiles made of natural fibers_ is not that easy. Another one talked about _partnerships for local supply-chains_ and mentioned the project _fibershed_ as a relevant reference (see for instance the [affiliate map](https://fibershed.org/affiliate-directory/) of the California-based fibershed). I contributed suggesting the creation of a fiber _commons_ - collectively governed common goods (there are some useful recommendations about it on my thesis' [references](https://wiki.reuse.city/en/opendott/thesis/references)). Another element I brought to the discussion was the need for _storage_ of materials, since in many cases circularity (and the extension of products' lifetime) is directly opposed to lean manufacturing and just-in-time principles. Reuse through upcycling and repairs requires a different relation to time and space (as would also be noted some days later in my [conversation with Ugo Vallauri](../online-sessions/01)). Similarly absent, according to participants, is _information about sourcing demands_ - which of course reminds me of my design concept called [Reuse Commons](https://wiki.reuse.city/solutions/reuse-commons).

One last note must be made about the mention to _Libraries of Things_ in response to both negative and positive questions. That probably means that while the idea of libraries of things is understood to be relevant for the field, there are not enough of them. Or, as informed by one experienced participant, they are not easy to navigate and understand, resulting in the existing ones being underutilised.

#### What is working?

Even recognising the missing elements described above, participants came up with a significant list of initiatives that seem to be relevant for sourcing of materials for textile circularity, listed below in alphabetical order:

- [COSUM](https://cosum.de).
- [GIFTD](https://www.giftd.app/).
- [Kleiderei](https://kleiderei.com/).
- [Kost√ºm Kollektiv](https://kostuemkollektiv.de/).
- [Kunst-Stoffe](https://kunst-stoffe-berlin.de/).
- [Material Mafia](https://www.material-mafia.net/).
- [Nochmall](https://www.nochmall.de/.
- [Textilhafen](https://www.berliner-stadtmission.de/textilhafen).

As noted above, there was also a mention to _Libraries of Things_ as being something that works, with the caveat that the ones inside libraries are organised in ways that are not intuitive for lay users.

Other positive references were the _free boxes_ available in some neighbourhoods where people can donate clothes and other objects, which reportedly manifest a _culture_ of sharing present in Berlin. That cn also be seen in the online platforms where people sell or exchange goods (I'd add examples such as [Kleinanzeigen](https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/stadt/berlin/), [Nebenan](https://nebenan.de/) and the many "Free your Stuff" [groups on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/freeyourstuff/), sometimes specific to some areas of the city).

**PS.:** In writing this short report, I decided to add additional examples that came to mind after the session. It's worth mentioning the [BSR-Kietzage](https://www.bsr.de/mein-sperrmuell-kieztag-30414.php), when the waste authority sets up pop-up collection points where neighbours can bring stuff they don't want. These events often become good opportunities for people to donate and exchange things. The reuse culture of Berlin can also be witnessed in the many flea markets around town, as well as in exchange initiatives like the [Systemfehler](https://www.systemfehler-berlin.org/) solidarity shop, the clothes swap events organised by [Trial and Error](https://www.trial-error.org/), among many other examples.


#### How to integrate people through libraries?

Participants pointed to the relevance of libraries as public spaces where _wide target groups_ can be reached. Ideas like _workshops for knowledge sharing_ and _boxes for collection of materials_ (while aware of the issue of storage mentioned above). And here again, there were suggestions of _pop-up_ structures for material collection, which could connect to _plug-in_ events that would circulate the mobile machines suggested earlier.
