**Relevance to CMVC**

Hub dedicated to sustainable fashion and part of the [Make-a-thek project with GIG](https://globalinnovationgathering.org/2025/03/12/make-a-thek-launched/).

I joined Make-a-thek's launch event last week (28/04) and ended up co-facilitating one of the discussion groups with participants after a colleague from Circular Berlin had to leave. The discussion topic was "materials and sourcing", which also connects to the CMVC project. Below are my comments about the session.

The discussion was structured along three questions:

- What is missing? (hardware, networks, skills, places)
- What is working? (what approaches can we build on?)
- How can we integrate people through libraries?

**What is missing?**

It's arguably predictable that any discussion about innovative approaches to sustainable and circular materials sourcing would inevitably mention the need for _money_ and _partners_. It is widely acknowledged that the incentive systems under the current global economic systems favour linear, unsustainable and inhumane manufacturing. Sourcing materials for circular fashion would certainly benefit from the availability of financial resources to counterbalance that condition.

The mention to partners as something that is not working is curious, though, since different stakeholders active in circularity are usually open to collaborations and partnerships. That take relates to the perceived lack of a _network of makers for workshops_, an indicative of _fragmentation_. On the other hand, participants also pointed _accessibility to machines_ as being problematic - while aware that machines do exist in Berlin, some reported that it's hard to have access to them as an individual not connected to institutions or brands. Someone suggested there should be _mobile machines for sharing_ between different areas and communities. 

Interestingly, none of the keywords described in the paragraph above is directly connected to sourcing and materials proper. On that theme, there were interesting comments. One participant said that finding _used textiles made of natural fibers_ is not that easy. Another one talked about _partnerships for local supply-chains_ and mentioned the project _fibershed_ as a relevant reference (see for instance the [affiliate map](https://fibershed.org/affiliate-directory/) of the California-based fibershed). I contributed suggesting the creation of fiber _commons_ - collectively governed common goods (there are some useful recommendations about it on my thesis' [references](https://wiki.reuse.city/en/opendott/thesis/references)). Another element I brought to the discussion was the need for _storage_ of materials, since in many cases circularity (and the extension of products' lifetime) is directly opposed to lean manufacturing and just-in-time principles. Reuse through upcycling and repairs requires a different relation to time and space (as would also be noted some days later in my [conversation with Ugo Vallauri](../online-sessions/01)). Similarly absent, according to participants, is _information about sourcing demands_ - which of course reminds me of my design concept called [reuse commons](https://wiki.reuse.city/solutions/reuse-commons).
