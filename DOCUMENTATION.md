# Documentation

CMVC is a participatory and open research project. As such, it is committed to publish not only its final outputs, but also to document openly its research notebooks, source data, meeting notes and other relevant materials. The project's documentation strategy is struvtured along the following:

- A [GitHub repository](https://github.com/reuse-city/CMVC) for raw data, anonymised conversation transcripts and research logs.
- An evolving [page on the Reuse City wiki](https://wiki.reuse.city/en/projects/circular-material-valuer-curriculum).
- A project page on the GIG website.

The final results such as the Curriculum and other relevant public documentation will be released with open licenses, on platforms to be defined with the participants and partner organisations. The project will also have ongoing channels of communication with participants, decided with them.
