# Notes - 24/03/2015

Starting to organise project documentation. I created thie repository and started collecting materials from previous projects - mainly connected to my [PhD research](https://wiki.reuse.city/opendott). I also did a quick exercise using NotebookLM to generate a summary of the project, using my thesis and interview transcripts as sources. What follows is a summaty of the project, generated by NLM:

> To create the "Circular Material Valuer" curriculum, investigations with organizations in Berlin should focus on understanding:
> *   **Essential Skills and Knowledge:** Identify the **core practical, theoretical, and sensory abilities** needed to assess the reuse potential of diverse materials and objects [Projeto description, You]. This includes how these skills are **learned and transferred**, often through **hands-on experience, informal learning, and mentorship**. Some skills may be acquired through formal education or inherited/learned from a young age. Prior professional experience in areas like repair, antique appraisal, or crafts can also be relevant. **Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing and guidance from experienced individuals** are crucial.
> *   **Practical Evaluation Methods:** Determine **how these organizations practically decide if something can be repaired, reused, recycled, or upcycled**, and the factors influencing these decisions [Projeto description, You, 101]. Criteria can include physical condition, functionality, potential demand, and repair costs [Projeto description, You]. Evaluation might be based on experience or more formalized processes.
> *   **Material Flow Management:** Learn **how materials are received, processed, and tracked** within the organizations.
> *   The **Role of Technology:** Explore **how technology can optimize the work of a "material valuer"** and what solutions are considered promising [69, You, 9].
> *   **Economic and Sustainability Aspects:** Understand **how reuse activities are financially viable and environmentally beneficial** [Projeto description, You, 204]. **Motivations** for working in this area can stem from a desire to **avoid waste, concern for environmental impact, and a belief in the inherent value of materials**. The **story and emotional connection** to objects can also be significant.
> *   **Collaborations and Networks:** Discover **how organizations interact and share resources or information** within the circular economy [Projeto description].
> *   The Influence of **Policies and Infrastructure:** Ascertain **what local factors and governmental measures** support or hinder reuse activities and the work of a "material valuer."
> *   **Effective Training and Education Approaches:** Identify the **best ways to learn the necessary skills** for this role [Projeto description]. A combination of **theory and practice, with an emphasis on "tactile" experience**, appears fundamental.
> Furthermore, it is important to investigate whether professionals in these organizations **recognize material assessment as a distinct professional role**. The figure of the **"[Non-English speech]" or "valoriste" in Nantes** suggests this recognition in some contexts. However, in other places, this evaluation might be part of the responsibilities of repairers, secondhand shop owners, or others. Understanding if a formal professional identity exists or needs to be created will be crucial for curriculum development. The **motivations** that brought individuals to this field are diverse, including a passion for reuse, environmental concerns, and the desire to give discarded objects new purpose.
