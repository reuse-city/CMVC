Circular Material Valuer Curriculum was "a citizen science initiative to explore the skills, experience and sensibility necessary to extend the lifespan of the growing volume of goods discarded or kept unused". Read more about the project in [this wiki page](https://wiki.reuse.city/en/projects/circular-valuer-curriculum).

Between April and September 2025, the project conducted participatory design activities to understand and document the skills, experience and sensibility involved in diverting unused and discarded goods from the waste stream, and collaboratively build an openly licensed curriculum to train circular material valuers. There were four phases, with some overlap between them:

- [Background Research](background).
- [Participatory Fieldwork](fieldwork).
- [Analysis and compilation](analysis).
- [Publication of results and outputs](outputs).

An open [documentation strategy](DOCUMENTATION.md) will be in place to ensure openness and public access.

The project is developed by [GIG](https://globalinnovationgathering.org) and the [Reuse City](https://reuse.city) studio, and funded by the Hans Sauer Stiftung.
